#  2023 Leaderboard
## Task 1: LVO Detection

<img src="res/task1-results.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

As a reference, here are the scores of a bootstrapped random classifier 95% confidence intervals:
- Area under the ROC curve (AuROC): 0.38-0.62 
- Average Precision Score (mAp): 0.41-0.61 
- Total score (AuROC and mAp average): 0.41-0.61

Artificial Doctors and AI Cracker 2023 teams reached essentially equivalent predictive performance, and they were well above the random classifier confidence intervals.

## Task 2: Reperfusion Prediction

As a reference, here are the scores of a bootstrapped random classifier 95% confidence intervals:
- Area under the ROC curve (AuROC): 0.27-0.73 
- Average Precision Score (mAp): 0.27-0.66 
- Total score (AuROC and mAp average): 0.27-0.73


No team was above the random classifier confidence intervals. Therefore, all teams have equally low predictive performance
